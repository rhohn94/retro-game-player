# TV mode (10-foot leanback experience)

> **Up:** [↑ Design index](README.md)

## Motivation

The north star is the couch: pick up a controller, browse a beautiful
art-forward library from ten feet away, and be playing seconds later. Today the
app is a desktop-density GUI — small type, mouse-first sidebar, 132px tiles.
TV mode closes epic [#8](https://github.com/rhohn94/harmony/issues/8)
(#9–#13) in one release: a dedicated leanback presentation layer that is
distance-legible, controller-first, art-forward, and seamless in and out of
games. It is the identity feature of a *retro game player* — without it the
product is a library manager, not a living-room console.

## Scope

**In scope**

- A first-class **TV mode** the user enters/exits explicitly (sidebar button,
  `Cmd+T`, controller long-press on `menu`) or automatically at startup
  (`auto_tv_mode` AppConfig flag, off by default, toggle in Settings →
  Appearance). Entering TV mode also enters OS fullscreen; exiting restores.
- **Leanback shell** (`src/features/tv/`): sidebar hidden; TV-safe margins
  (5% overscan inset); a 10-foot type/spacing token scale (`*-tv` tokens
  layered over the existing theme in the `harmony-theme` cascade layer);
  content on full-bleed art backdrops.
- **Home shelves**: horizontally-scrolling cover-art rails — *Continue
  playing*, *Favorites*, *Recently added*, and per-console rails — beneath a
  **key-art hero** region that crossfades to the focused game's full-bleed art
  (title, system, play affordance). Data from the library-life foundation
  ([library-life-design.md](library-life-design.md)).
- **Distance-legible focus + snap navigation**: enlarged focus treatment
  (scale + ring + glow readable at 3m), scroll-snap rails, focused tile always
  fully on-screen; built on the existing spatial engine
  ([controller-input-design.md](controller-input-design.md)).
- **Seamless game entry/exit**: confirm on a tile animates the tile into a
  full-screen takeover while the in-page player boots (boot screen + sound
  intact — auto-boot with sound is the retro vibe, never a muted or gated
  boot); exit returns to the same shelf position with the reverse transition.
  Native and external paths get the same takeover chrome.
- **Retro-but-Aura aesthetic**: CRT-adjacent flourishes (subtle scanline
  texture on the hero, phosphor-glow focus accent, chunky pixel-font accents
  for section labels) expressed **through Aura tokens** (colors, motion
  durations/easings from `src/lib/motion.ts` / `src/theme/motion.css`), never
  hardcoded literals; honors `prefers-reduced-motion` centrally.

**Non-goals**

- CRT/scanline *display filters over gameplay* (#23, v0.29 Craft).
- Keyboard-accessibility completion (#29).
- Collections management UI (rest of #21).
- A separate windowed "TV preview" — TV mode is fullscreen.

## Design

- **Mode model**: `TvModeProvider` (`src/features/tv/TvModeContext.tsx`)
  owning `{ active, enter(), exit() }`; persisted last-state is *not* kept —
  only `auto_tv_mode` governs startup. Mounted in `App.tsx`; when active, the
  shell renders `<TvShell/>` (own router outlet: TV home, TV game detail)
  instead of the desktop sidebar+routes tree. Desktop state is untouched
  behind it; exit restores the previous route.
  - **Implementation note (W260):** rather than keeping the desktop route
    tree mounted-behind while TV mode is active, `App.tsx`'s `Root` component
    conditionally renders `<TvShell/>` OR `<Shell/>` (never both) based on
    `tvMode.active`, inside a single `<AnimatePresence mode="wait">`. The
    desktop tree fully unmounts on enter (stopping its gamepad-focus
    registrations, IPC polls, etc. from running invisibly under the TV
    surface) and remounts fresh on exit. `TvModeProvider` snapshots the exact
    route (`pathname + search`) and the fullscreen state at `enter()` time and
    restores both on `exit()`, so nothing is lost despite the unmount — the
    user returns to the same screen they left. A single shared `useFullscreen()`
    instance (hoisted in `App`) is passed to both `Shell` and
    `TvModeProvider` so the desktop fullscreen button and TV mode's own
    enter/exit stay in sync.
- **Tokens**: `src/theme/tv.css` defines the `*-tv` scale (type ramp ×1.6–2.0,
  tile 320×440, safe-area insets, rail gap) inside the existing cascade
  layers; components consume tokens only (token-adoption guard applies).
- **Shelves**: `TvHome.tsx` composes `<TvHero/>` + `<TvRail/>` list. Rails are
  virtualized-light (windowed rendering ≥50 items). Rail rows register with
  the spatial-focus registry; left/right moves within a rail, up/down across
  rails, with per-rail focus memory. `TvRail` sources: `list_recent`,
  `list_favorites`, recently-added (existing `added_at`), per-system queries.
  - **Implementation note (W261):** the rail model + traversal are split into
    pure, unit-tested helpers — `rails.ts` (`buildRails` ordering/hiding +
    `railWindow` windowing math), `railNav.ts` (`resolveRailNav` row/column
    traversal with the hero as the top row + `rememberFocus` per-rail memory),
    and `systems.ts` (console labels + recency ordering). The base spatial
    engine (`controller/spatial.ts`) is a geometric nearest-neighbour with no
    notion of "rail" or "remembered column", so `TvHome` **installs an
    exclusive controller handler** (`ControllerProvider.setExclusiveHandler`)
    for its lifetime and drives focus through `resolveRailNav` instead — the
    only way to honour per-rail focus memory and treat the hero as a
    first-class row. `confirm` on a tile (or the hero) routes through one
    `tvMode.launch(gameId)` seam (added to `TvModeContext`): it navigates to
    `/game/:id` and leaves TV mode so the desktop router mounts the auto-booting
    detail page — W265 replaces that seam's body with the shared-layout takeover
    without touching any TV-home component. First mount seeds focus onto the
    first tile of the first populated rail (the hero's play button otherwise
    claims initial focus, since it registers first).
  - **Implementation note (W262 — distance-legible focus + snap):** the W261
    handoff flagged the focused tile's ring/glow clipping at the rail
    viewport's top edge. Root cause: `.rgp-tv-rail__row`'s vertical padding
    (`--rgp-tv-rail-row-pad`) was sized for the label + row rhythm, not for
    the focus scale-up + glow, and the row's horizontal padding reused
    `--rgp-tv-safe-area` (as small as ~5vmin), which can fall short of the
    scale+glow footprint on a compact viewport — clipping the first/last tile
    horizontally too. Fix: a new derived token, `--rgp-tv-focus-clearance`
    (`theme/tv.css`) — half the tile's scale-up growth plus the glow radius
    plus the ring width — added on top of BOTH the row's existing padding
    (vertical) and the safe-area inset (horizontal), and mirrored into
    `.rgp-tv-tile`'s `scroll-margin-block`/`scroll-margin-inline` so native
    scroll-into-view (the mirrored-DOM-focus mechanism `TvTile` already uses)
    leaves the same breathing room on every edge, first/last tile included.
    Also added: unfocused tiles dim to `--rgp-tv-focus-dim-opacity` (0.72) so
    the focused one visually leads; the focused caption switches from
    single-line ellipsis to full wrapped text (the scaled-up tile has the
    width/weight to carry it). D-pad **hold-to-repeat** was added to
    `useGamepadPoll` (a pure `navRepeatDue(heldMs, msSinceLastFire)` scheduler,
    unit-tested like `longPressElapsed`): a held nav button re-fires after
    `NAV_REPEAT_DELAY_MS` (400ms) then every `NAV_REPEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (150ms),
    scoped to the four `nav_*` actions only (confirm/back/menu/quit stay
    single-fire). Keyboard-arrow rail navigation was **not** added — TV mode's
    non-goals already scope full keyboard accessibility to #29, and no
    keyboard→SemanticAction bridge exists anywhere in the controller layer
    today, so "native key-repeat" for keyboard applies only to the desktop's
    existing native `<button>`/`tabIndex` elements (a browser built-in,
    nothing to implement).
- **Hero**: focused-game key art via the high-res tier
  ([metadata-art-design.md](metadata-art-design.md)); crossfade ≤300ms on
  focus settle (debounced ~150ms), gradient scrim for legibility.
  - **Implementation note (W261):** `TvHero` resolves its own art URL via
    `useGameArt(game, "snap", { surface: "hero", allowFetch: true })` and
    renders the crossfading full-bleed layer itself (AnimatePresence keyed on
    the URL, `DUR.base` fade), rather than delegating to `HeroBackdrop`'s
    local-only lookup — so the hero's one-shot network fetch actually paints
    (only the single featured hero fetches; the tiles stay local-only). The
    featured game is the LAST **tile**-focused game, held even while focus sits
    on the hero's own Play button, so moving up to Play never blanks the hero.
    The hero art breaks out of the shell's 5% safe-area padding (negative
    margins) so it bleeds to the frame edge while the copy stays title-safe;
    retro-but-Aura flourishes (static scanline overlay + a breathing phosphor
    glow) are token-driven (`tv.css`) and neutralised centrally under
    reduced-motion.
- **Transitions**: Framer Motion shared-layout takeover from tile →
  fullscreen player surface; player boot happens *under* the expanding tile
  art so the swap is invisible; exit reverses to the originating tile
  (scroll restored first). All durations/easings from the motion source.
  - **Implementation note (W265):** the takeover is an OVERLAY, not a route or
    mode swap. `TvModeContext.launch(game, originRect)` sets a `launched`
    `{ game, originRect }` (replacing W261's navigate-to-`/game/:id` seam);
    `App.tsx`'s `Root` then renders `<TvGameSurface/>` on top of the *still-
    mounted* `<TvHome/>` inside `TvShell`. Keeping the home mounted is what
    makes exit land exactly where the user left — its per-rail focus memory and
    scroll position are component-local state that would be lost by an unmount,
    so an overlay is the only design that restores focus for free (no explicit
    scroll/focus save-and-restore needed).
  - **Reveal contract (the honest part):** the sequencing is a pure, unit-tested
    state machine (`tvTakeover.ts`): `idle → expanding → revealed`, with `exit`
    going `→ collapsing → idle`. `beginTakeover` captures the originating tile
    rect; the cover-art layer (boxart-first via the SAME `useGameArt` resolver
    the tile used, so no swap flash) animates that rect → full-viewport while
    `PlaySwitch` mounts and boots UNDERNEATH — boot screen + sound intact, never
    gated, never muted. `revealPlayer` fires on the next animation frame (the
    player surface EXISTS by then), crossfading the cover OUT: the reveal is
    driven by the surface existing, *not* a fixed timer, so the EmulatorJS boot
    screen (part of the retro vibe) is never held under the cover artificially
    long. `beginCollapse` reverses (cover fades back in over the running game and
    shrinks to the tile), then `onExited` drops the overlay. `revealPlayer` and
    `beginCollapse` are idempotent so their triggers can fire more than once
    safely. Reduced motion makes `beginTakeover` jump straight to `revealed` (no
    expand) — a plain crossfade, degrading to an instant swap once the app's
    central reduced-motion policy zeroes the durations.
  - **Controller ownership:** the exclusive-handler slot is single-owner. While a
    game runs, the in-page/native player owns it (so `PlayerOverlay`'s
    menu/back → Resume/Save/Load/Exit works unchanged); the external surface —
    which has no player — installs its own back/menu → Return handler. `TvHome`
    gates its own exclusive-handler install on `!launched`, releasing on launch
    and re-asserting it when the surface unmounts, so the home never fights the
    running game for the controller.
  - **Exit seam:** the players take an optional `onExit` (threaded through
    `PlaySwitch`); the TV surface passes one that begins the collapse, while the
    desktop detail route leaves it undefined and the players fall back to
    `navigate(-1)`. Session cleanup is identical to the desktop path —
    `usePlaySession` (W264) is mounted inside each player, so it brackets the
    TV-mounted player's lifetime too.
  - **Three play paths share the chrome:** in-page + native mount `PlaySwitch`
    under the expanding art (native's canvas boots under the cover just like the
    iframe); external RetroArch-only systems (`!canPlayInPage`) land on
    `TvExternalSurface` — a branded "Running in RetroArch" panel that fires the
    external `launch_game` itself and offers a 10-foot Return control, matching
    the desktop path's honesty about external play.
- **Auto-enter**: `AppConfig.auto_tv_mode: bool` (Rust `config/mod.rs`,
  default `false`) + `get_config`/`set_config` IPC already present; on mount,
  `App.tsx` reads config and calls `enter()` once when set.
- **Controller**: TV mode raises no new input layer — it registers ordinary
  focus targets; `back` at TV home exits TV mode (with confirm), `menu`
  long-press toggles TV mode anywhere outside gameplay.
  - **Implementation note (W260):** `useGamepadPoll` only emits rising-edge
    semantic actions (one fire per press — the right behavior for
    confirm/back/nav) and has no notion of held-duration, so the long-press
    detector is a small, independent hook
    (`src/features/controller/useLongPress.ts`) rather than an extension of
    the shared poll. It reads the same raw Gamepad API and the same pure
    `resolveBindings`/`detectFamily` helpers, tracks one action's
    continuously-held duration via its own rAF loop, and fires once at the
    `LONG_PRESS_MS` (600ms) threshold — mirrored as the
    `--rgp-tv-long-press-ms` token in `theme/tv.css` for any CSS-side
    consumer. `useTvModeControllerToggle` (in `src/features/tv/`) wires it to
    `menu`; "outside gameplay" holds by construction because the in-page/
    native player installs an exclusive controller handler
    (`ControllerProvider.setExclusiveHandler`) while a game is running, which
    makes every other action source — including this poll — a no-op until
    released.

## Acceptance

_Checked off by W26A (v0.26 Pass 6, the final quality gate). Evidence noted per
bullet: test name / screenshot path / measured value._

- [x] TV mode can be entered and exited via sidebar button, `Cmd+T`, and
      controller `menu` long-press; enter goes fullscreen, exit restores the
      prior desktop route and window state.
      — Wired in `App.tsx`: sidebar `📺 TV mode` button (`FocusableTvModeButton`),
      `useTvModeAccelerator` (`Cmd/Ctrl+T` → `enter()`/`exit()`),
      `useTvModeControllerToggle` (`menu` long-press). Enter couples
      `fullscreen.setFullscreen(true)`; `TvModeProvider.exit()` restores the
      snapshotted route + fullscreen state (`TvModeContext.tsx`).
- [x] With `auto_tv_mode: true`, a fresh launch lands directly in TV home
      (verified via mock-IPC visual inspection).
      — visual-inspect `tv-home` route (mockOverride `get_auto_tv_mode: true`)
      renders the TV shell + "CONTINUE PLAYING"; screenshot
      `artifacts/visual-inspection/tv-home.png`.
- [x] TV home shows hero + ≥3 rails (Continue playing, Favorites, Recently
      added) populated from fixtures; per-console rails appear for systems
      with games.
      — Measured: hero present + 7 rails: `Continue playing, Favorites, Recently
      added, NES, SNES, Genesis, Nintendo 64` (per-console rails for every
      system with games). `tv-home.png` shows the hero + populated first rail.
- [x] All TV surfaces are fully controller-navigable (rail traversal, hero
      focus, game launch, back-out) with no pointer required.
      — `TvHome` installs an exclusive controller handler driving
      `resolveRailNav` (unit-tested: `railNav.test.ts`); hero is the top focus
      row (`HERO_FOCUS_ID`); `confirm` launches via the one `tvMode.launch` seam;
      `back` runs the two-press exit-confirm. Tiles/hero/external-Return all
      register `useFocusable`.
- [x] Focus treatment legible at distance: focused tile scales ≥1.08 with a
      high-contrast ring; rails snap the focused tile fully into view.
      — Measured: focused tile `transform: matrix(1.12…)` (≥1.08), ring
      box-shadow present, unfocused tiles dim to opacity `0.72`; the last tile
      after focus is fully within the rail row bounds (native scroll-into-view +
      `scroll-margin` clearance, W262).
- [x] Launching from a tile plays the takeover animation and boots the game
      with sound (no manual play gate); exiting returns to the same rail +
      tile position.
      — `tvTakeover.ts` state machine (unit-tested `tvTakeover.test.ts`); the
      cover expands tile→fullscreen — screenshot
      `artifacts/visual-inspection/tv-takeover.png` (cover mid-expand). Boots with
      sound (no gate): `PlaySwitch` mounts under the cover, iframe `allow="autoplay"`,
      default `volume: 1` (never muted). Exit keeps `TvHome` mounted behind the
      overlay, so the originating tile stays focused (measured: same tile focused
      after launch; the overlay design restores focus + scroll for free).
- [x] Type/spacing/margins come from `*-tv` tokens; token-adoption and motion
      guards stay green; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the flourishes.
      — `token-adoption.test.mjs` + `motion.test.mjs` + `aura-wiring.test.mjs`
      green; `pnpm lint` clean. Measured under reduced motion: the hero phosphor
      breathe `animation-duration` collapses to `0.01ms` via the single central
      `theme/motion.css` rule (no per-component media query).
- [x] `recipe.py smoke` passes with TV routes included in visual inspection.
      — `recipe.py smoke` exits 0; visual-inspect walks `tv-home` + `tv-takeover`
      (+ the desktop `game-detail` route), is rebuild-aware (fails loudly on a
      stale `dist/`), and reports zero console/page errors on all TV surfaces.

## v0.27 "Immersion" (W272/W273/W275) — takeover play experience, hover-attract, gap audit

First real couch sessions on v0.26.x surfaced two takeover defects and one
missing beat (all user-reported 2026-07-03), plus a standing request to
re-audit the whole feature.

### W272 — Takeover play experience (fullscreen + input ownership)

**Defect 1 — the porthole.** `TvGameSurface` correctly fills the viewport,
but the player inside still wears its desktop detail-page styling:
`.rgp-player__frame` caps at `max-width: 760px` / `aspect-ratio: 4/3`
(library.css) — a desktop card floating in a TV-sized black field.

**Defect 2 — leaked controller input.** `InPagePlayer` claims the
controller's exclusive slot while mounted; **`NativePlayer` never does** (the
comment in TvGameSurface asserting otherwise is wrong). TvHome correctly
releases its handler on launch, so with a native game running the BASE
spatial engine is live over the still-mounted home: PS ✕ = `confirm` =
"launch the focused tile" — pressing ✕ in-game swapped the running game.

Fix contract:

- **Fill presentation.** `PlaySwitch` (and both players) accept the takeover
  surface's presentation: the player fills its container edge-to-edge
  (`max-width: none`, no aspect box, canvas/iframe letterboxed by
  `object-fit: contain` on black), TV-scale chrome only — the desktop
  chip bar (`.rgp-player__bar`) is hidden on the TV surface; the overlay
  (menu/Escape/controller ☰) is the sole in-game menu, styled at the
  `--rgp-tv-*` scale when in TV mode.
- **Input ownership.** Extract InPagePlayer's exclusive-handler pattern into
  one shared hook (`src/features/play/`), adopted by BOTH players: while a
  player is mounted foreground, it owns the exclusive slot — overlay closed:
  `menu` opens the overlay, every other semantic action is swallowed (game
  input reaches the core via the raw gamepad poll, not semantic actions);
  overlay open: `nav_up`/`nav_down` move the selection, `confirm` activates,
  `back`/`menu` close. Backgrounded/attract presentations do NOT hold the
  slot (the page owns the controller). This also gives the native path
  controller-driven overlay menus (previously keyboard-only).
- The stale TvGameSurface comment is corrected to describe the real
  contract.

Acceptance: launching from a TV shelf fills the frame edge-to-edge on both
player paths; with a native game running, every controller button either
reaches the game or the overlay — none reaches the home underneath; the
overlay is fully controller-drivable on the native path; desktop detail-page
play is visually unchanged.

### W273 — Hover-attract (5 s dwell boots a live preview)

Dwelling on a shelf tile for 5 s (`--rgp-tv-attract-dwell-ms: 5000` — one
constant, keyboard-focus and pointer-hover alike) boots that game as a
**live full-bleed preview** behind the home: the hero backdrop layer hands
off to real gameplay, dimmed under the existing scrim so rails stay legible,
audio ducked to the W235 attract gain (0.3 × user volume — the boot sound is
part of the vibe, quietly). Input never attaches: the preview is a spectator
surface; the controller keeps navigating the home.

- **Purity (hard requirement):** a preview must not leave a trace — no
  library-life play-session record (no play count / recency / play-time), no
  SRAM writes, no exit auto-save-state. The native session starts in a
  preview mode that omits save wiring end-to-end (frontend skips
  `usePlaySession`; the start command's preview flag passes `saves: None`).
- **Scope v1: native-capable games only** (the purity guarantee is
  structural there). EmulatorJS-only systems keep today's static art;
  extending previews to the EJS path (needs save-suppression through the
  iframe glue) is a recorded follow-up.
- **Lifecycle:** the dwell timer resets whenever the focused/hovered tile
  changes; moving away, launching anything, opening the exit-confirm, or
  leaving the home tears the preview down (short crossfade, central
  reduced-motion policy). At most one preview session ever exists; a real
  launch always boots fresh (the boot screen is the retro beat, and the
  preview session's core is torn down first).

Acceptance: dwell 5 s on a native-capable tile → live gameplay fades in
behind the home with ducked audio; play counts / Continue-playing / saves
are byte-identical before and after a preview; input never leaks; moving
focus tears it down within a frame's crossfade; external/EJS tiles never
attempt a preview.

### W275 — Gap audit (re-evaluate the whole feature)

After W272/W273 land: a dedicated audit pass walks every §Acceptance bullet
in this document plus the v0.27 contracts above against the real code, and
exercises the interplay seams: exit-confirm vs takeover, pause-on-blur
during TV play, W235 detail-page attract vs W273 TV attract, auto-TV-mode
boot straight into takeover, focus restoration after exit, external-path
controller handling, reduced-motion variants, keyboard-only parity. Small
gaps are fixed in the audit branch; anything structural is recorded in §5
follow-ups with a design note.

### W275 audit — findings

Every contract and seam below was verified against the code on
`fix/w275-tv-gap-audit` (Pass 3), not against this document. Verdicts:
**OK** (holds as specified), **fixed** (gap closed in this branch),
**follow-up** (structural — recorded in §Follow-ups, not started).

| # | Contract / seam | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | v0.26 acceptance: enter/exit affordances + fullscreen restore | fixed | Entry/exit + route/fullscreen snapshot hold (`TvModeContext`), but `InPagePlayer` forced window-fullscreen OFF on every exit/unmount — exiting an EJS game inside the takeover dropped TV mode (and desktop F11) out of fullscreen. Now gated on the player's own immersive mode. |
| 2 | v0.26 acceptance: `auto_tv_mode` boot → TV home | OK | `useAutoTvModeOnStartup` (one-shot read, silent degrade); smoke `tv-home` route covers it. Boot-seeded focus starts the W273 dwell — intended. |
| 3 | v0.26 acceptance: hero + ≥3 rails + per-console rails | OK | `useTvLibrary` + pure `buildRails`. |
| 4 | v0.26 acceptance: fully controller-navigable, no pointer | OK | `railNav` exclusive routing; hero top row; single launch seam. |
| 5 | v0.26 acceptance: distance-legible focus + snap | OK | 1.12 scale / ring / glow / dim + `scroll-margin` clearance tokens (W262). |
| 6 | v0.26 acceptance: takeover boots with sound; exit returns to the same tile | fixed | Sound/reveal contract holds (`tvTakeover`); controller focus survives by the overlay design — but native DOM focus did not (see #16). |
| 7 | v0.26 acceptance: `*-tv` tokens + central reduced motion | OK | Guards green; new W272/W273 motion rides `DUR`/`EASE` + `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`; takeover has an explicit reduced-motion path (`beginTakeover` → `revealed`) + collapse safety net. |
| 8 | W272: edge-to-edge fill on both players; desktop unchanged | OK | `.rgp-player--takeover` scoped rules; chip bar hidden; overlay at TV scale. |
| 9 | W272: no controller action reaches the home under a running game | fixed | Held for a healthy player, but the single-ref exclusive slot left NO-OWNER windows (in-page origin resolution, native→EJS failure swap, GetCorePanel which claims nothing) where the base engine ran over the hidden home — the W272 defect resurfacing on degraded paths. Replaced with a layered claim stack (`exclusiveStack.ts`, unit-tested) + a surface-level swallow-all fallback claim on `TvGameSurface` for every path. |
| 10 | W272: overlay controller-drivable on the native path | OK | `routeScopedAction` (unit-tested) via the shared scope. |
| 11 | W273: 5 s dwell, one constant, hover + keyboard focus alike | OK | `TV_ATTRACT_DWELL_MS` ⇄ `--rgp-tv-attract-dwell-ms`; pointer hover folds into controller focus (one dwell key). |
| 12 | W273: purity (no play record / saves / perf log) | OK | `presentationRecordsPlaySession` (frontend) + `session_side_effects` (backend), both unit-tested; preview renders bare canvas, skips even the Continue read. |
| 13 | W273: input never attaches; teardown rules; one session max | OK | Spectator gates keyboard + poll + claim; dwell hook clears on any key/eligibility/gate change; backend `NativeSession` is a replacing singleton, and the preview unmount-cleanup dispatches before the takeover's mount start (same commit). |
| 14 | Seam: exit-confirm vs takeover | fixed | The armed confirm survived a launch — a quick play-and-return inside its 3 s window let a SINGLE `back` silently exit TV mode. `launch()` now disarms it (`useTvExitConfirm.cancel`). While a takeover runs, `back` never reaches the home (claim stack), so the two can no longer fight. |
| 15 | Seam: pause-on-blur (W243) in TV mode | fixed | Takeover players share the desktop blur/focus handlers — sane. But the dwell kept counting behind a Cmd+Tab and booted an AUDIBLE preview in a backgrounded app, which pause-on-blur cannot catch (the blur predates the session mount). Dwell + fired preview now gate on window focus (`useWindowFocus`). |
| 16 | Seam: focus restoration on exiting a game (incl. after a preview) | fixed | Controller focus was already exact (overlay design). DOM focus wasn't: the origin tile kept it under the running game (stray Enter re-fired its launch; Tab reached hidden home controls), and nothing restored it for keyboard users on exit. The home is now `inert` while launched and `focusElement` re-asserts DOM focus on the focused tile at takeover end. A preview never moves focus — nothing to restore. |
| 17 | Seam: external/RetroArch path inside TV | OK | One-shot launch guard, honest state line, Return as the single focus target; ownership covered by the surface fallback (confirm/back/menu → Return). |
| 18 | Seam: reduced motion on every W272/W273 animation | OK | All Framer-driven off the central motion source under `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`; CSS side neutralised by the one `theme/motion.css` rule. |
| 19 | Seam: keyboard parity | fixed | Tab/Enter navigation, Cmd+T, Escape-overlay all held — but an EJS game in the takeover was UNPLAYABLE by keyboard (the iframe only receives keys when DOM-focused; nothing focused it without a pointer). The in-page player now focuses its iframe in the takeover presentation. |
| 20 | Seam: `menu` long-press "outside gameplay" | fixed | The W260 comment claimed the exclusive slot gates the long-press poll — false: `useLongPress` reads the raw pad itself, so holding Start ≥600 ms mid-game toggled TV mode (desktop: unmounted the running game). Now gated on the provider's `gameplayClaimActive` (set by the shared player scope) and threaded the persisted `menu` rebind overrides (W267 parity). |
| 21 | W273 race: dwell fires as the user presses confirm | OK | Same-commit ordering (preview unmount cleanup → takeover mount) + the backend's replacing session singleton; a batched dwell+launch never mounts the preview at all. |
| 22 | W273: native-play disabled / ROM missing / core absent mid-dwell | OK | `startNativePlay` rejects → `onStartFailed` → the game is silently marked failed for the mount (no visible error, never retried). Cosmetic residue → follow-up (hero-art handoff below). |
| 23 | W272 follow-up: PlayNotice/GetCorePanel desktop-scaled in takeover | fixed | Scoped `--rgp-tv-*`-scale rules under `.rgp-tv-game-surface`; the notice also stacked BESIDE the fallback player at half width (row flex) — now a banner above it. |
| 24 | W272 follow-up: redundant "Full screen" overlay item in takeover | fixed | `presentationAllowsImmersive` (unit-tested) — the item only exists on the desktop foreground player. |
| 25 | W272 follow-up: native one-frame Start race | fixed | The overlay-open flag is now mirrored into the poll ref eagerly, so the same-frame input poll can't re-send the Start bit and stomp the release-to-zero. |

**Ownership model change (audit fix #9, load-bearing):** the controller's
exclusive slot is now a *claim stack* (`controller/exclusiveStack.ts`), not a
single nullable ref. Owners call `claimExclusive(handler, kind)` and release
by identity; the top claim receives actions, and a release uncovers the claim
beneath. Kinds: `"ui"` (TV home, takeover fallback) vs `"gameplay"` (a mounted
player via `useExclusiveControllerScope`) — `gameplayClaimActive` is the
app-level "a game owns the pad" signal (gates the `menu` long-press toggle).
Ordering: the takeover surface claims its fallback in a **layout** effect so a
player's **passive**-effect claim always lands above it. Earlier §Design notes
describing `setExclusiveHandler` reflect the pre-W275 single-slot API.

## Open questions

- Per-console rail cap (all 20 systems would be noisy) — start with "systems
  that have ≥1 game", ordered by recency.
- Whether hero uses snap/title art when boxart-only exists — yes, fall back
  boxart → blurred boxart backdrop.

## Follow-ups

- CRT display filters over gameplay (#23, v0.29).
- Attract-mode idle screensaver (rolling game art) in TV home.
- Collections rail once full #21 lands.
- EmulatorJS-path attract previews (save-suppression through the iframe glue)
  — W273's recorded v1 scope cut.
- **Controller-drivable GetCorePanel in the takeover (W275 audit #23):** the
  panel's "Get core" button is pointer/keyboard-only; the takeover's fallback
  claim deliberately swallows `confirm` (only `back` exits). A 10-foot
  affordance would register the button as a focus target and route confirm to
  it — needs a small focus wiring pass in `GetCorePanel`, not just CSS.
- **Gate the hero-art→preview handoff on the first painted frame (W275 audit
  #22):** `TvHome` flips `artHandedOff` the instant the preview layer mounts,
  so the hero art crossfades out over a still-black canvas for the boot beat —
  and flashes black briefly when a preview's start FAILS before the silent
  fallback unmounts it. Threading a "first frame painted" signal out of
  `NativePlayer`'s frame loop would make the handoff seamless and make a
  failed preview visually invisible.
